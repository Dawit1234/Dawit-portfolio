# Dawit-portfolio
Dawit's Project Portfolio was created to professionally showcase my web development skills and completed projects. It serves as an organized, accessible collection of my work for potential employers, recruiters, or collaborators to view real examples of my capabilities in HTML, CSS, and user-focused design.
